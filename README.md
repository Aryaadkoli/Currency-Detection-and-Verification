# Currency-Detection-and-Verification

This project was made for the course Digital Image Processing.
The program calculates the HSI values of the input image and determines the value of the input currency note.
Then the input image undergoes various image processing steps. The input image and an original image are compared. If the similarity is more than a specified percentage then the input currency image is considered legitimate.

Our model works only for the images specified in the test sample images. This code can be modified to obtain results in real time.

For this code to run properly, all the files have to be downloaded into the same folder. Then run the python file. See the demo video for a more clear understanding. The output images couldn't be captured in the demo video.
